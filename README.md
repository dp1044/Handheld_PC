# Handheld_PC
These are the files and tutorial for the Handheld gaming PC I made. 

The case is based off the handheld project from TommyB.  I have modified the case to make it modular so that you can use different mini pcs.  This one is currently using the Beelink SER5 Max mini pc.

The controller is based on the waveshare RP2040-Zero using GP2040-CE.
